\title{Create Smoothing Structure Specification with Priors}
\usage{
smoothing_structure(smoothing_type, tau_mean = NULL, tau_sd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{smoothing_type}{Character string specifying the smoothing type:
\itemize{
\item \code{"shared"}: All pathogens have the same smoothing parameter
(equivalent to \code{tau[1]}). By default a model with a single pathogen
will have \code{shared} smoothing type.
\item \code{"independent"}: Independent smoothing per pathogen
(equivalent to \code{tau[number of pathogens]})
\item \code{"correlated"}: Correlated smoothing type (equivalent
to \code{Sigma[number of pathogens, number of pathogens]})
}}

\item{tau_mean}{Optional numeric vector specifying the prior mean(s) for tau
parameter. Can be provided for \code{shared} (single value) and \code{independent}
smoothing types (can provide a single value which will be repeated for
each pathogen or can provide a unique prior for each pathogen). Prior for
tau for \code{correlated} smoothing type is not currently supported.}

\item{tau_sd}{Numeric vector specifying the prior standard deviation(s)
for tau parameter. Can be provided for \code{shared} (single value) and \code{independent}
smoothing types (can provide a single value which will be repeated for
each pathogen or can provide a unique prior for each pathogen). Prior for
tau for \code{correlated} smoothing type is not currently supported.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{EpiStrainDynamics.smoothing} containing:
\item{smoothing_type}{The specified smoothing structure type}
\item{tau_priors}{Prior specifications for tau}
}
\description{
This function creates a standardized smoothing structure object that specifies
both the smoothing structure and associated priors for EpiStrainDynamics models.

\examples{
# Shared smoothing with scalar priors
shared_smooth <- smoothing_structure("shared", tau_mean = 0, tau_sd = 1)

# Independent smoothing with vector priors
indep_smooth <- smoothing_structure("independent",
                                    tau_mean = c(0, 0, 0),
                                    tau_sd = c(1, 1, 1))
