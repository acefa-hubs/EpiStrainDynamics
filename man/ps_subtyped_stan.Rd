\arguments{
\item{num_data}{number of data points}

\item{num_knots}{number of knots}

\item{num_path}{number of pathogens}

\item{knots}{the sequence of knots}

\item{spline_degree}{the degree of spline (is equal to order - 1)}

\item{Y}{outcome variable, eg daily number of cases}

\item{P1}{daily number of lab tests positive for influenza A (must be 1st
column) and all other pathogens}

\item{P2}{daily number of influenza A subtypes eg H3N2, H1N1}

\item{X}{time data}

\item{week_effect}{Number of distinct days in day of week effect. 1 = single
effect shared by all days (essentially no DOW), 7 = each day a unique effect}

\item{DOW}{integer of day of the week}

\item{cov_structure}{0 is tau of 1, 1 is tau of
num_path, 2 is Sigma with two dimensions: num_path, num_path.}

\item{noise_structure}{0 only includes observation noise (same between
pathogens), 1 includes noise in individual pathogens as well}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to `rstan::sampling` (e.g. iter, chains).}
}
\value{
An object of class `stanfit` returned by `rstan::sampling`
